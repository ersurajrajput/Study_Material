ğŸ”‘ Java Collection Types:
Collection:
The root interface for all other collection types (except Map).

List:
An ordered collection that can contain duplicate elements.
ğŸ”¸ Examples: ArrayList, LinkedList

Set:
A collection that cannot contain duplicate elements.
ğŸ”¸ Examples: HashSet, TreeSet

Queue:
A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing.
ğŸ”¸ Examples: PriorityQueue, LinkedList (when used as a queue)

Deque (Double-Ended Queue):
Allows insertion/removal from both ends.

Map:
Stores key-value pairs, and is not a subtype of Collection.

ğŸ”¸ ğŸ”¸ ğŸ”¸ ArrayList:-
        internal working same as array.
        when array is full new array is created (big size) and the elements of old array is copied in new array
        default size of initial array is 10.
        internal working same as array.
        growth factor is 1.5 (so if old array is 10. then new array will be 15)
    ğŸ”¸ ğŸ”¸Adding:-
            checks if has enough space or not. if not then create new array
            Time complexity O(n)
     ğŸ”¸ ğŸ”¸Removing:-   
            removes element and then shifts other elements
